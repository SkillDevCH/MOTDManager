# MOTDManager

With this plugin you can simply set up your MOTD on your Minecraft server.

I had created this plugin 4 years ago in German. I thought I might upload it sometime.

## Installation

Either you get the [JAR file](https://github.com/SkillDevCH/MOTDManager/releases/download/1.0/MOTDManager.jar) yourself or you download it from the [releases](https://github.com/SkillDevCH/MOTDManager/releases/download/1.0/MOTDManager.jar).

Then you have to move the plugin to your plugin folder and restart/reload the server.



## Usage

```
You can set color codes with the & 
/motd 1 <text> Changes the first row of the MOTD
/motd 2 <text> Changes the second row of the MOTD
```
